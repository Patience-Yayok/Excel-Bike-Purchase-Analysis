### Cleaning Up:

Step 1:De-duping: I found 26 copies of the same data and got rid of them.

Step 2:Simplifying Letters: I replaced "M" and "S" in the marital status column with "married" and "single" for easier understanding.

Step 3:Age Ranges: I added a new "age bracket" column, grouping people like this:
Under 31: Teenagers
31-54: Middle-aged adults
55 and above: Seniors
### Digging Deeper:

Step 4:Gender and Bikes: I figured out which gender bought more bikes.

Step 5:Income and Bikes: I checked if people's income affects their bike purchase decision.

Step 6:Commute and Bikes: I saw if commute distance impacts bike buying.
### Visualizing Results:


Step 7:Income & Bikes: I created a chart showing average income based on who bought bikes.

Step 8:Commute & Bikes: Another chart analyzed if commute distance influences bike buying.

Step 9:Age & Bikes: A final chart revealed which age group bought the most bikes (turns out, 31-54 year olds!).
### Interactive Dashboard:

Step 10:Putting it all together: I combined all the charts into a single dashboard.

Step 11: Make it your own: I added filters for marital status, region, and education, letting you explore the data further.
